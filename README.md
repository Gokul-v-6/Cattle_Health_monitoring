# Cattle_Health_monitoring
A IOT Based system Integrated with a ML model that predicts Cattle health status bases on its activities , temperature and stress level
A real-time cattle health monitoring and disease prediction system using IoT sensors, ThingSpeak cloud, and machine learning models.

ðŸ“‹ Project Overview

This project integrates affordable sensors with an ESP32 microcontroller to monitor cattle health in real-time. Data collected includes temperature, pulse, and motion, which is transmitted to ThingSpeak for visualization and analysis. A MATLAB-based machine learning model (Random Forest) processes the data to predict the cattle's health status as Healthy, Ovulation, or Unhealthy. Alerts are triggered via email for unhealthy conditions.
